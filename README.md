Hi! we are [Anderson Godoy](https://github.com/AndersonAGodoy) and [Rodrigo Batista](https://github.com/rfreitasbatista) and we are Students of [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). 

In April 22th we started a Fullstack development course at TRYBE. So in less than 2 months of this, we createad a simple covid website to verify and compare statistics of different countries through charts just with the skills learned there.

We used [BOOTSTRAP](https://getbootstrap.com/), [CHARTJS](https://www.chartjs.org/), [APEXCHART](https://apexcharts.com/), [FONT-AWESOME](https://fontawesome.com/) to build this site.

And the data to build graphics and tables was (https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.json) and (https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries)
